# naturalFRUIT
naturalFruit is a unit testing framework developed for Fortran programs maintained in pure Fortran. It is derived from the original [Fortran Unit Test Framework (FRUIT)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranxunit).  

The major objectives that naturalFRUIT aims to achieve are:  
1. **Independance from other programming languages**: The philosophy behind maintaining naturalFruit as a separate project is to ensure that a Fortran programmer shouldn't need to learn a whole new programming language for the sake of testing Fortran code.  
2. **Documentation**: Clear and updated documentation and tutorials based on the auto-generated [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) framework.  
3. **Improvements**: Constant improvements in phase with the latest Fortran versions.  


@warning
Documentation, tutorials and source code are under active development
