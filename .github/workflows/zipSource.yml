# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: zipSource

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push using v1.0 or similar to trigger build
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push using v1.0 or similar to trigger build

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "zipsrc"
  zipsrc:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
