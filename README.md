# naturalFRUIT
A purely Fortran based unit testing framework derived from the original [Fortran Unit Test Framework (FRUIT)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranxunit/).

## Why the new project?
1. FRUIT utilizes the Ruby programming language to aid auto-generation of code and making of reports easier. However, this seems to hinder users from adopting the testing framework due to the time spent setting up additional dependencies as well as having to learn a new programming language. naturalFRUIT maintains the Fortran modules necessary for testing without the Ruby dependencies.
2. FRUIT documentation appears to be generally lacking for intermmediate to advanced users. This project will utilize auto-generated documentation using [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) in addition to tutorials on the GitHub Wiki.  
3. FRUIT also appears to not be updated constantly. Hopefully, improvements to Fortran will be reflected in FRUIT through this repo through collaborative development.

## Documentation
Documentation of naturalFRUIT is available [here](https://cibinjoseph.github.io/naturalFRUIT/page/index.html).   
A list of subroutines for use while unit testing is available [here](https://cibinjoseph.github.io/naturalFRUIT/lists/procedures.html).

## Usage
This repo is under very active development and a lot of drastic changes are being made at the moment. These include removal of depreciated and redundant subroutines and functions. Until this disclaimer is removed, users are cautioned against using naturalFRUIT and advised to use the original FRUIT module.

## Contibution
All contributions through pull requests are accepted.
