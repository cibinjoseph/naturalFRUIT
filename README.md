# naturalFRUIT
A purely Fortran based project derived from the original [Fortran Unit Test Framework (FRUIT)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranxunit/).

## Why the new project?
1. FRUIT has additional bells and whistles that utilize the Ruby programming language. Although this does help in auto-generation of code and making of reports easier, this dependency appears to hinder users from adopting the testing framework.  
2. FRUIT documentation appears to be generally lacking. This project will utilize auto-generated documentation using [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) in addition to tutorials on the GitHub Wiki.  
3. FRUIT also appears to not be maintained. Hopefully, improvements to Fortran will be reflected in FRUIT through this repo.
