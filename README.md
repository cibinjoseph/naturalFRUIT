# naturalFRUIT
A purely Fortran based project derived from the original [Fortran Unit Test Framework (FRUIT)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranxunit/).

## Why the new project?
1. FRUIT utilizes the Ruby programming language to aid auto-generation of code and making of reports easier. However, this hinders users from adopting the testing framework due to the time required to set up the additional dependencies as well as having to learn a new programming language.
2. FRUIT documentation appears to be generally lacking for intermmediate to advanced users. This project will utilize auto-generated documentation using [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) in addition to tutorials on the GitHub Wiki.  
3. FRUIT also appears to not be updated. Hopefully, improvements to Fortran will be reflected in FRUIT through this repo through collaborative development.
